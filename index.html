                 <p>Earlier in the day, Modi lauded the Tokyo Olympic winners and Covid warriors. “In 75 weeks of the ‘Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav’, 75 ‘Vande Bharat’ trains will connect different parts of the country, the prime minister announced. The development of Jammu and Kashmir is visible on the ground, Modi said, adding that the delimitation exercise is on and preparations are underway for assembly polls there. PM Modi also hoisted the tricolour at the Red Fort before his speech.

                    Hours after PM Modi’s address, the Congress accused him of only making announcements about schemes in his Independence Day speeches and not implementing them, even as it hit out at him for not withdrawing the three farm laws against which the farmers have been protesting. Meanwhile, West Bengal CM and TMC chief Mamata Banerjee called for strengthening voices against all forces that try to stifle freedom.

                    The Taliban takeover of the country last weekend shocked Western nations, coming just two weeks before the deadline for all troops to fully withdraw from the country.

                    Taliban's statement came a day after US President Joe Biden said he still hopes to complete the "heartbreaking" evacuation from Afghanistan by the end of the month. Meanwhile, Britain said Monday it would urge the US to extend the August 31 deadline for evacuations from Afghanistan.
                    
                    However, the Taliban, who have so far sought to strike a more moderate tone, showed no willingness to compromise on the US pullout.

                    The Income Tax department, an arm of India's Ministry of Finance, said in a tweet Parekh would be asked to explain why after 2-1/2 months since the launch of the new e-filing portal, glitches have not been resolved.

                    "Since 21/08/2021, the portal itself is not available," Income Tax India said in a tweet.
                    
                    A message on the website read "Portal is going through a maintenance. Inconvenience caused is regretted."
                    
                    Infosys did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.
                    
                    Sitharaman had tweeted to Infosys and its co-founder Nandan Nilekani a day after the launch of the e-filing portal in June, asking for grievances and glitches to be resolved, and to "not let down our taxpayers".
                    
                    Nilekani had replied saying Infosys expected the portal to stabilise during the week, and was working to resolve glitches.
